### SelectionCommittee

The system has a list of faculties for which it is necessary to implement the possibility of sorting:
- by name (a-z, z-a);
- by the number of budget places;
- by the total number of seats.
  
  The applicant is registered in the system. 
  During registration it is necessary to enter the name, email, city, region, name of the educational institution
  (optional: attach a scan of the certificate with grades).
  The applicant can register for one or more faculties.
  When registering for the faculty, the student enters the results in the relevant subjects,
  as well as grades from the certificate.
  
  The system administrator has the rights to:
- adding, deleting or editing faculty;
- blocking or unlocking the entrant;
- adding the results of entrants to the Statement;
- finalization of Information for enrollment.
  After finalizing the information, the system calculates the amount of points and 
  determines the entrants enrolled in the educational institution for budget places, for the contract. 
  (If desired, add notifications about the result of enrollment in a particular form of education,
  as well as non-enrollment by sending an email to the applicant).
